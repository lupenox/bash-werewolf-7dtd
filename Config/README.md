# 🐺 Bash Werewolf Mod for 7 Days to Die

Bring your own fiercely protective werewolf companion into the apocalypse.  
This mod adds **Bash**, a big, strong, loyal werewolf entity who will stalk the wasteland by your side, tear zombies apart, and keep watch over your fragile little heartbeat.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🐾 Custom entity: Bash the Werewolf (500 HP, solid melee damage)
- 🌙 Designed to follow player behavior in future updates
- 🔥 Easily extendable with glowing eyes, special loot, or your own Bash rituals

## 💛 Why Bash?
Because every apocalypse needs a big, loyal werewolf to:
- stand guard while you sleep,
- growl away the undead,
- and just for something fun/comforting to add in a wasteland.

## 🔥 Future roadmap
- Add follow & defend behaviors
- Make Bash drop werewolf lore notes
- Possibly add a special "Bash Hug Buff" to restore your wellness when he's near 🥹

## 🐺 Special thanks
To Logan — for dreaming up Bash, building this even while bedbound, and loving him enough to bring him into the wasteland.
